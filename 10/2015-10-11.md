## 笔记

- A environment is a sequence of frames.
- Each frame is a table (possibly empty) of binding, which associate variable name with their corresponding values.
- A single frame may contain at most one binding for any variable
- Each frame also has a pointer to its enclosing environment, unless, for the purposes of discussion, the frame is considered to be global.
- 上面这句话有些费劲，我这里翻译下：每个 frame 都有一个指向外围环境的指针，但以讨论为目的时，frame 被视为全局的，并不存在外围环境这一概念，也可以理解为这一指针指向 `null`。
- To describe interactions with the interpreter, we will suppose that there is a global environment, consisting of a single frame (with no enclosing environment) that includes values for the symbols associated with the primitive procedures. 
- For example, the idea that + is the symbol for addition is captured by saying that the symbol + is bound in the global environment to the primitive addition procedure.
- The overall specification of how the interpreter evaluate a combination:
  1. Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination. (An evaluation order is needed, but it is considered to be an implementation detail, and one can't write programs that depends on some particular order) 
  2. Apply the value of the operator subexpression to the values of the operand subexpressions.
- In the environment model of evaluation, a procedure is always a pair consisting of some code and a pointer to an environment.  
- **Procedures are created in one way only: by evaluating a λ-expression. This produces a procedure whose code is obtained from the text of the λ-expression and whose environment is the environment in which the λ-expression was evaluated to produce the procedure.**

- **To apply a procedure to arguments, create a new environment containing a frame that binds the parameters to the values of the arguments. The enclosing environment of this frame is the environment specified by the procedure. Now, within this new environment, evaluate the procedure body.**
