## Is Logic Programming Mathematical Logic?

The aim of logic programming is to provide the programmer with techniques for decomposing a computational problem into two separate problems:

- “what” is to be computed
- “how” this should be computed


Our query language can be regarded as just such a procedurally interpretable subset of mathematical logic.

- An assertion represents a simple fact (an atomic proposition).
- A rule represents the implication that the rule conclusion holds for those cases where the rule body holds.

A rule has a natural procedural interpretation: To establish the conclusion of the rule, establish the body of the rule.

Rules, therefore, specify computations. However, because rules can also be regarded as statements of mathematical logic, we can justify any “inference” accomplished by a logic program by asserting that the same result could be obtained by working entirely within mathematical logic.

## infinite loops

```
(rule (married ?x ?y)
      (married ?y ?x))
```

## problems with not


```
(and (supervisor ?x ?y)
     (not (job ?x (computer programmer))))

(and (not (job ?x (computer programmer)))
     (supervisor ?x ?y)
```
上面两个查询的结果是不一样的。

- 第一个查询首先找出符合`(supervisor ?x ?y)`的查询，然后过滤掉`?x`满足`(job ?x (computer programmer))`的情况
- 第二个查询首先过滤掉所有`(job ?x (computer programmer))`的情况，然后再过滤掉所有的情况，这时产生的新框架为空，导致最终的结果也为空

这里的问题在于not的实现，是用它来过滤掉变量的值，如果一个变量是未绑定状态，那么这时就会有问题了。`lisp-value`也存在类似的情况。

in other words, the not of logic programming languages reflects the so-called closed world assumption that all relevant information has been included in the data base
